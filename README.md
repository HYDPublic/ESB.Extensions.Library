# ESB.Extensions.Library

ESB Library Extensions is a solution containing multiple .Net Projects and artifacts. This solution is geared towards extending/wrapping the current Microsoft ESB 2.2 toolkit and components.

Throughout the lifetime of this project, many items will be added to help extend the Microsoft BizTalk ESB 2.2 toolkit. The current BizTalk artifacts which can be found inside this library will be, the HTTP Adapter Provider, MSMQ Adapter Provider, WSS Adapter Provider and Custom BRE Resolver, which can be used for Itineraries, Maps, Endpoints, and Policy Brokering. If you would like to see other items added please open up a Discussion thread and we will try to adhere to your request.

This project is an update to the existing [ESB Extensions Library found for BizTalk Server 2010](https://esbextlibrary.codeplex.com "ESB Extensions Library for BizTalk Server 2010")
